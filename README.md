## My process

- I started by going through the designs
- Then wrote the HTML code
- After I was satisfied with the HTML I went on to write CSS
- There were some HTML elements I had to change while busy with the CSS in order to fit the layout
- After doing the basic CSS needed I also started writing Javascript to handle actions

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

```css
/* CSS code I'm proud of */
.container {
  position: relative;
}
.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```
